Carefull we need to do it 2 times. One time on the top of picture (blue/black colors) and one time one bottom of picture (green). So we can have top and bot objects.

In some, we need top black, bottom white. You just have to press "q" and parameters are save into a file.


Note: 

#top [0, 46, 0, 79, 255, 255] <br>
#bot [0, 95, 0, 255, 255, 255] are the good parameters the current wall. With this light intensity (day intensity different night intensity)

But this is for the three first picture who's represent the same caracteristics of light. It show the importance of the wall parameters.

So for each hours or a changement of light (like a cloud pass) <strong>the wall_parameters</strong> must be modify.

For the moment it must be manually, maybe it could be automatic.

Care it's not finish 100% because i need more picture with more holds on the wall !
