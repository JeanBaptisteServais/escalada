But this is for the three first picture who's represent the same caracteristics of light. It show the importance of the wall parameters.

So for each hours or a changement of light (like a cloud pass) <strong>the wall_parameters</strong> must be modify.

For the moment it must be manually, maybe it could be automatic.

Care it's not finish 100% because i need more picture with more holds on the wall !
