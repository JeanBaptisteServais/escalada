Picture here: 

wall_parameters permet to modify parameters of the wall. With the file we can raise the background and recup the pieces.

Carefull we need to do it 2 times. One time on the top of picture (blue/black colors) and one time one bottom of picture (green). So we can have top and bot objects.

In some, we need top black, bottom white. You just have to press "q" and parameters are save into a file.
